Nothing of value here outside of laughs from me fumbling about

Fibonacci.py:
A basic program that adds the two preceding numbers together (0,1,1,2,3...)

PrimeChecker.py:
A script that checks if different stores have available delivery times.  Requires selenium and geckodriver (using Firefox in headless mode). REV - updated timeout to 2 to prevent errors if gecko takes longer to reach pages.
